This is my test program to learn the Athena Widgets.

When compiling, broken dependancies must be resolved manually.

requires:
stdlib
stdio
math
X11
Xt
Xaw

...This is going to be <sarc>fun</sarc>. I've got to:
-take angles stored as:
  -percentages (because xaw)
  -signed shorts (because joysticks)
-normalize those to radians (because maths)
-convert them to degrees for display (because babalonians)
-convert them to rotation matricies for OpenGL (because...idek)

But more on that later at the main game repo
